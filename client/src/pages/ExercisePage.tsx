                     The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines <strong className="text-indigo-600">physical activity</strong> as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. The energy expenditure can be measured in calories. Physical activity in daily life can be categorized into occupational, sports, conditioning, household chores, or other activities. <strong className="text-indigo-600">Exercise</strong> is a subset of physical activity that is planned, structured, and repetitive, with an objective to improve physical fitness. Levels of physical activity are described as sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous and athlete.

                  <p className="mt-8">  
                    Globally, we are leading <strong className="text-indigo-600">increasingly sedentary lifestyles</strong> due to the rise of technology (screen time) and urbanization (motorised transport). Sedentary behaviour is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and increased mortality rates. Incorporating scheduled exercise may appear burdensome to our demanding lifestyles, but we can achieve physical activity through short bouts without specialised equipment or expensive gym memeberships. Walking 5000 steps per day (about 3km) or a 20 minute bout of body weight exercises can be sufficient to achieve the recommended levels of physical activity to improve our health and well-being.

                    For substantial health benefits in adults aged 18-64 years, WHO recommends at least:

                      <strong className="text-indigo-600">150 to 300 minutes</strong> of moderate intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week;

                     For additional health benefits, adults should also do <strong className="text-indigo-600">muscle strengthening activities</strong> at moderate or vigorous intensity that involve major muscle groups, for 2 or more days a week.

                      Protects the integrity of barriers: organelles (mitochondria and nuclei) cell membranes, internal barriers (blood-brain), and external barriers (intestinal, respiratory, skin).

                    <li>
                      Contributes to the maintenance of local and systemic homeostasis (promotes wound healing, decreases risk of infection, anti-inflammatory, modulates innate and adaptive immune responses, decreases risk of certain cancers ).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Benefits recycling and turnover of cells, organelles and proteins (cellular remodelling, turnover of dysfunctional organelles ).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Stimulates coordination and adaptation of intracellular (metaboloic changes) and systemic (endocrine) circuitries.

                    <li>
                      Modulates circadian rhythms: a nonphotic cue capable of restoring the transiently disturbed clock.

                    <li>
                      Promotes homeostatic resilience and beneficial adapations in response to stress: modifies neural mechanisms, increases mobilisation of substrates, increases insulin sensitivity, enhances immunosurveillance and immunocompetence, alters intestinal microbiome.

                    <li>
                      Benefits hormetic regulation. Hormesis is the concept of an adaptive biphasic dose response that may be applied to various fields including biology. At low doses, a stimulus can positively promote or regulate the physiological functions of organisms, and at high doses disrupts balance and leads to harmful effects.

The study concluded that vigorous physical activity of 15-20 min/week is associated with a 16-40% lower mortality hazard ratio, with further decreases up to 50-57 min/week. 'These findings suggest reduced health risks may be attainable through relatively modest amounts of vigorous physical activity accrued in short bouts across the week'.
